intense."

men dragged two fellows out of the bus. Once outside they were 
beaten into pulp. These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets 
and they were being beaten by all and sundry. I thought to 
myself -""what is life?"". It is one hell of a place where

the other one just for a living, (money). When I think about 
such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and 
dejected."

I was even more petrified then."

guy."

high rank. This was a few years ago when my friend told me about 
the result."
"A few weeks back I had a very important seminar and I had 
circulated my papers to all the panel members. A day before the

When my studies are too demanding and I cannot cope with it.
The behaviour of people spitting everywhere.
When I finished the work that I had planned to do - my homework.
"I was not prepared for the exam but I wanted to sleep the night 
before the exam."
Someone played a trick on me.

them."
"It was a narrow and dirty passage which was located near the 
market and I had to stand there to wait for people."

happy. They are my closest friends and we had not seen each 
other for a long time."
"The hero was chased by a terrible vampire in a suspense and 
horror film shown on T.V."
"I worked with several classmates on a project. I was very 
anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern 
and when we had meetings on the project my classmates did not 
pay any attention. Some of them read books while the others 
argued on irrelevant questions. The meeting would go on for two 
hours without the main theme being discussed. We wasted time and 
could not reach a compromise. My classmates avoided doing the 
work and the responsibilities, they seemed to value other 
projects more than this one."
"One of my good friends had to migrate to America. Our friendship 
had developed quite well and it was a pity as our friendship would 
fade."
"In a study group, a person always liked to argue on some 
unimportant, irrelevant and minor points. He tried to persuade 
others in an unfriendly way. He was obstinate and would not accept 
other's point of view."
"I remember my religious experience. During a gospel camp, a few 
friends of mine decided to believe in God. The joy that I felt 
at that time was more than words can express. I blessed them and 
praised God in my heart."
"My friend and I had offended our classmate unintenionally. We 
wanted to apologize to her so we decided to visit her. We knew that she 
was stubborn so we were frightened. When we rang her door bell, 
our fear was at it's climax"
"My girlfriend disliked it when I played majong (a game of gambling). 
I expressed my regrets and when I went to see her she neglected my 
existance. I was very angry and left in displeasure."
"When I said good-bye to my girlfriend. I had spent two years on 
developing this relationship and it was unsuccessful, I felt very 
sad."
"My classmate got a ""B"" for his homework while I only got a ""C"". 
When we got the results he acted as if he did not merit this 
grade. I found that his humility was hypocritical and I found it 
disgusting."
"I learnt from the newspaper that I had been accepted at the 
Chinese university of H.K. It was 7 o'clock in the morning. 
Later I told my family and relatives about it and had tea with 
them very joyfully."
"I was camping in an old broken hut which had no lights. I had 
brought along a lamp which was not working very well. The door 
made strange sounds and I was sure that strange things were 
happening. The most terrifying bit was that there were many 
wardrobes in the hut and everytime that I looked in the glass of 
the wardrobe I felt that there were ""objects"" behind me. The 
whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."
"During a football match, the other team was rude and they hurt my 
team members and me. The coach was prejudiced against us and 
punished us unreasonably. Later we fought with each other and 
the match had to be cut short."
"I heard of the death of a closefriend of mine. I had gone camping 
with him shortly before his death and the whole thing seemed very 
sudden to me."
"A group of youngsters dressed in fads talked foul language on a 
bus. They also insulted the pedestrians on the road and were 
impolite to the passengers of the bus."
"After a busy day I went back to my hostel. I closed the door and 
had a drink, then I read my favourite book on the bed. Suddenly 
I felt peace and joy."
"When I went home and there was nobody, I waited till 2 A.M and 
still nobody. I was suddenly scared and anxious as this had never 
happened before. In addition my mother was very weak and I 
feared that she had met with an accident. Therefore I was anxious 
all night."
"Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had 
abused her 2 month old son and had caused his death. I was very 
angry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse 
so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin."
"I had a schoolmate who went to the hospital as her brain was 
bleeding. She fell unconscious for three days and when I went 
to see her I saw the miserable state the family was in. Moreover 
I could not do nothing for her. I was very sad. Finally, she 
died."
"A tiresome person held me up all day long. I was very busy then 
(I can not remember what the problem was). He continously tried 
to make me talk to him and disturbed me."
"I was appreciated by others, especially my family members and my 
friends."
"Whenever I am alone in a dark room, walk alone on the street, 
sleep alone in the room at night or see something which is only 
partly visible. This emotion was very strong when as an 8 year 
old child I saw something horrible."
"[ Whenever I put myself in other's shoes and try to make the 
person happy, comfort him or make friends and I am misunderstood 
and rejected, especially when this person is a family member or a friend.]"
"There was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of 
mine. He only thought about his own interest and not about our 
friendship. This behaviour hurt his friends. Another incident 
is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons."
When I saw a lot of rubbish and animal waste on the floor.
"When I received the letter informing that I had been accepted to 
be a Chinese university student, I was excited as I had longed 
for it."
"One day when I was a little boy, my friends asked me to play 
with them outside and to catch some boys. However our parents 
did not know that we were out and when I got home it was very 
late and I feared being scolded by my parents."
"When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to 
another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and 
attitudes. I was very angry."
"About two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate. 
This really gave me a shock as I had never thought that she would 
say such things. The reason she gave me was that we were not 
suited for each other."
"Once while studying for my exam I found so many complicated words 
that it disgusted me."
"[ During a certain period, I felt successful and extremely satisfied. 
When I found that any tasks or decisions that I had made were better 
than expected.]"
I am scared when I stroll alone on the Chung Chi college campus.
"One day, I discussed a very important question with A. A 
suddenly declared that he would not accept my position and 
thought that he himself was right. Moreover, he attacked 
strongly, not my opinion but me personally."
"When I learnt that I had failed an exam, This not only influenced 
my emotions but also other important tasks, it also made my 
record imperfect."
"[ I would classify subjectively, a certain gesture or the way of 
talking of a person as disgusting or inacceptable.]"
"I felt happy when I received the letter telling me that I had 
been admitted to the university."
"During the first year in university I had bad results in both 
the terms, especially the first term. I was afraid that I would 
not be promoted to the next year and that the others would go 
ahead of me."
Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
"A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within 
two years. We had not finished our studies then and could not 
bear our responsibilities as her children. My mother had tried 
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two 
years. Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as 
cancer is incurable. I was very eager to replace her in 
suffernig , even die instead of her."
"I used to play with a group of classmates and I found out later 
that they were cheap in thought, behaviour and conduct - they 
would smoke, fight and speak foul language. I thought that they 
destroyed the image of college students."
"One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had 
been in a bad mood of late). I hoped to go for a walk in the 
soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits. When I was having 
lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to 
why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me 
before). One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would 
look very nice if we wore them together."
"The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it. But I 
had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare 
for the exams. Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would 
not be able to finish it."
"A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for 
the homework and not social gatherings. We were very busy and 
the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an 
hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then."
"After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would 
have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and 
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would 
understand this as they had always done). They did not 
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many 
other activities. Their reaction made me burst into tears."
"When I was studying in the library a pair of lovers were sitting 
next to me talking in an intense and soft voice. They were 
disturbing others."
"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W). It was 
during the first term Summer vacations. We met each other while 
handing in our homework. He invited me have a trip with him and 
we were together till 8 P.M."
"The day the results of the certificate exam came out. I went to 
school and at first I did not feel frightened. By the time I 
reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the 
fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would 
die."
"One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back 
in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and 
wore it. He had not had a bath and was very dirty. I scolded him 
but he answered back and locked himself up in a room. I was very 
angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly 
and freely."
"When I was a child I was playing on the upper deck of the bed 
with my brother. My parents slept on the lower deck. My father 
felt disgusted and beat me up. I felt very sad as my father had 
never beaten me or scolded me before."
"My boyfriend and I did not have any contact with each other during 
the Summer holidays. I met him the day of the registration and looked 
through him. In the canteen he asked me if I wanted to have a drink and 
I said no as I did not want him to do me a favour."
"I had gone camping with my old classmates and there was a storm. 
We were in a flurry but at that time I felt the love and concern 
of my friends."
"I was on a trip to Phillipines during Summer and I was staying in 
a hotel. The room I was staying in was very silent and had very 
dim lights. The last night I felt frightened and lay awake - I 
could hear some sounds around me and dared not open my eyes - I 
waited for dawn."
"I had a very good friend in secondary school. The year after our 
graduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off 
all my appointments. I got together the other friends and we 
were ready to give the entire day to her. However this friend 
disappeared on her birthday. When I phoned another friend I 
didcovered thay she was busy, I did not call her anymore."

seems that I am deceiving myself but I cannot find the way out."

even threatened her with a pair of scissors."
"My academic result was poor and I had to repeat the second year. 
I felt sad about the coming several years."

She treated us strictly and punished us physically. These 
things were intolerable."
"I was admited to the Chinese university of Hong Kong. The day 
the results were announced I looked in the newspaper and saw my 
candidature number."
"One year, when I went to a camp, I was chased by a dog. I tried 
hard and finally managed to escape from it. My torch suddenly 
went off and we talked about ghost stories and I thought that 
there were ghosts."

I tried my best."
"I had a date with my girlfriend, the time and place had not been 
fixed. I asked her to phone me an hour later as it was midnight 
and I did not want to disturb her family. I waited several hours 
for her call, she did not call me that night."
"When I found that my ability to do ordinary work was worse than 
my fellow mates."
"I made friends with a classmate whose behaviour I did not like - 
he tried to flatter other people and did not respect me."
"During my Summer vacations I planned a carnival for the community 
youth center with a few other volunteers. I was the head of the 
organizors and we spent over a month planning it. During this 
period we got to know and understood each other. We 
discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting 
things for the carnival. The day of the carnival everything was 
bright, the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it. 
I felt extremely excited about it."
"I was a prefect at secondary school. On the sports day I told 
others that I would take down the names of the people who 
misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest. 
Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others. 
I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he 
picked on me. I thought that a brief rest was not serious 
enough to be blamed."
"I had joined a youth group that observed the affairs of our 
community and so I had many opportunities to contact the 
government and the committee members of the district board (a 
local executive structure). We always tried to consult and 
discuss with them, but we found that such people did not 
understand community affairs and they even dampened our 
enthusiasm in local affairs. I did not understand why they had 
decided to work as community leaders."
"When high level results were declared, I found my candidature 
number. I was very happy as I had not expected it. As I had been

angry. She fainted suddenly and I was very scared as I did not 
know what to do ."
"When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. 
It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I 
lost some documents - identity papers. As a result I had to 
spend several days in order to get a new one. I will always 
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I 
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil 
servant. I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a 
criminal. At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with 
them."
"I quarrelled with my younger sister because I had said something 
against her boyfriend. Consequently she looked through me when

the road. I got goose flesh because of this."
"After attending a song contest proposed by a band called ""Chyne"" 
we (6 of us) waited for the members of the band to greet us in 
front of the stage. We went out after a few minutes as it was 
time to close the hall. We had been waiting at the entrance hall 
for ten minutes when three of the band members came out. They 
were very excited to see us, one of them was so excited that he 
had tears in his eyes. We felt very warm and close to each 
other. They took us back into the hall and we talked freely. We 
were together for about an hour and during this time we felt 
that they were very sincere."
"At noon one Sunday I received a phone call telling me that my 
mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and 
that her husband should go and see her. I could not believe this 
as my father and my mother had gone out together to buy lunch 
boxes. However I immediately ran to the scene of the accident."
"The day the results of the Chinese university was announced I 
should have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of 
her prejudice and misunderstanding, started a quarrel with my 
mother. She expected me to take her side and she deliberately 
talked of my mother's wrong doings. I was very angry because - 
one my grandmother was not being reasonable and two because it 
should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new 
house that day."
"When I was in lower six class during the Summer I joined a 
research group of the Chinese university student union. I knew 
a lot of CV students there. A year later one of them was 
travelling in mainland China and he got T.B. He died a few weeks 
after coming back to H.K. We all got together for the funeral 
and when I looked at the body for the last time I felt extremely 
sad."
"During these Summer vacations a schoolmate who was not in my 
class went to Britain. Before he left, his classmates and some 
of us who were accquainted with him had a B.B.Q on the beach. 
When I arrived I saw that some people , who were not close 
friends of the departing person(person A), were playing mahjong. 
Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides 
it was A who had prepared the food. Later when we wanted to talk 
and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him. 
They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they 
talked on their own. Some of their conversation was against me and 
another classmate."

"When I was ill and had to stay at the hospital for a period of 
time."
"A few days back I was waiting for the bus at the bus stop. 
Before getting into the bus I had prepared the exact amount of 
coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put 
these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair. I 
thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside. However the 
bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins 
were stuck at the opening of the box. He had not seen me paying 
and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box. I could not 
understand this and the driver kept questioning me. He made me 
feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just 
to get away from him. Later I found that I had forgotten a few 
coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first 
time. After I had entered the bus I could still hear him 
scolding me and I felt disgusted."
"I had a dream : I had a very close friend who had several stone 
houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have 
much furniture. He took me to see his fields (I had never seen 
them before) and there were several inches of clear water on 
which the sunshine was reflected. I wanted to sit among the 
short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the 
plants to death. My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat 
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."
"After seeing a horror film - Omen. I could not sleep at night 
even though I closed my eyes. The last scene of the film kept 
coming back to me, I seemed to hear the girls in the film 
shouting at the devil. The devil did not have any expression on 
his face and I thought that he would choose me."
"My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that 
he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's 
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him. I 
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so 
he should not have behaved like that. I was very angry (as it is 
I was in a bad mood then)."
"I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good 
friends did not care for me. Although I could still be with them 
I felt unimportant. I deeply thought about the reason behind 
this so as to see who was responsible for this. Finally I made 
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them. I was 
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends."
"I had a friend who was very kind to me. I tried my best to like 
him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help 
rejecting, criticizing and blaming him. I wanted to get away 
from him as soon as possible."
"During the exam period I studied in the library alone. A close 
friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my 
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had 
been accepted. I was not very sure as I did not know that the 
list had been declared. I ran to the board and saw that I was 
really included in the list. I was so excited that I smiled all 
day long. When I met my classmates and friends I told them the 
good news. I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my 
studies. 
"
"A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes 
outside. I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would 
question me on our relationship. I treated him as a friend and 
did not want any misunderstandings. Therefore I refused to meet 
him and told him that I would see him the coming day. I was very 
unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble."
"We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the 
inter-department song contest. I arrived and found that there

lunch. I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them 
and then left."
"A friend told me that he had suffered in love and in academics. 
I shared his sadness."
"A friend told me that a boy wanted to get to know me. At that 
time I felt disgusted and thought that it was a nonsense thing."
"That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the 
higher level as fast as possible. I opened the envelope very

antique lift. The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very

uncomfortable. He never listens to my complaints and I curse him 
furiously in my mind. I cannot solve this problem by violence 
because of traditional moral values."
"My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it 
was true. In the past I would have at least 80% marks. Was I 
getting weaker at studies ? This made me feel that I should not 
expect too much from going to the university."
"My friend and I worked for the community centre by holding a booth. 
One day my friend went off to another booth to play. This

several friends as she was a friend's friend. However my friend 
had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I 
smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen 
me. Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry."

subject if I were to change it."

cracked jokes, I was very happy. However, I felt that I may have 
said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad 
impression of me."
"I did not do well in one of the subjects last term. I was 
afraid that I would fail. My result was a grade D, though it was 
not good I still passed. I felt more comfortable then."
"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname. I felt 
insulted and kicked his hip in anger. I was stable later and did 
not feel angry at him. In fact I was afraid that the other 
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant 
person. However I could not apologize, so I pretended that 
nothing had happened and smiled when I left. My friend did not 
say anything but just watched me leave."

the result was announced I feared that I would fail. Finally I 
got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all

"
"It was a week before the higher level results were announced. I 
had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that 
I was taking the exam. I knew that if i failed again I woulld 
have to enter the society. I imagined things during this period 
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice 
experience. When I thought about the future, an unexplainable 
fear rose in me. I feared being a worker and not having a bright 
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my 
brother had gone to university. Whenevr I thought of this issue 
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."

grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it. This

C.U.H.K admission) arrived. It was in the afternoon and I had 
not been doing anything. When the postman, with his big bag,

opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. 
It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was 
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very 
unsatisfactory. I thought that I had only a 50% chance of 
passing. Even if I failed this subject I would not need to 
repeat. However I liked this subject very much and my results 
were bad because of my lazyness. If I was forced to change to a 
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not 
like. The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation 
was like a debate. The atmosphere was very bad. When he learnt 
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost 
5 marks."" I was very angry, not because my marks were lower 
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride. I did not 
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
"This issue worried me rather than saddening me. In mid September 
I went to Guanggho alone. I was looking for an accomodation in 
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not 
find anything. What could I do? I was not worried about 
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems. 
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock."
"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had 
melody but had no content. We lived together so when he played 
the recorder I was forced to listen to them. I could not tell 
him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right 
to disturb the freedom of others. So I would find a pretext to 
leave the room and go somewhere else."
I received a letter from a distant friend.
"My parents were out and I was the eldest at home. At midnight a 
male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language. I 
hung up and heard someone walking outside our door."
"I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the 
door. I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit 
and bring the germs in the house."
