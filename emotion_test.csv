house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him. I 
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so 
he should not have behaved like that. I was very angry (as it is 
I was in a bad mood then).",anger

friends did not care for me. Although I could still be with them 
I felt unimportant. I deeply thought about the reason behind 
this so as to see who was responsible for this. Finally I made 
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them. I was 
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends.",sadness

him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help

friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my 
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had 
been accepted. I was not very sure as I did not know that the 
list had been declared. I ran to the board and saw that I was 
really included in the list. I was so excited that I smiled all 
day long. When I met my classmates and friends I told them the 
good news. I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my 
studies.

outside. I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would 
question me on our relationship. I treated him as a friend and 
did not want any misunderstandings. Therefore I refused to meet 
him and told him that I would see him the coming day. I was very 
unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.",fear

not good I still passed. I felt more comfortable then.",fear

insulted and kicked his hip in anger. I was stable later and did 
not feel angry at him. In fact I was afraid that the other 
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant 
person. However I could not apologize, so I pretended that 
nothing had happened and smiled when I left. My friend did not 
say anything but just watched me leave.",anger

had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that 
I was taking the exam. I knew that if i failed again I woulld 
have to enter the society. I imagined things during this period 
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice 
experience. When I thought about the future, an unexplainable 
fear rose in me. I feared being a worker and not having a bright 
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my 
brother had gone to university. Whenevr I thought of this issue 
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased.",fear

C.U.H.K admission) arrived. It was in the afternoon and I had

opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. 
It lasted several hours and only calmed down later.",joy

afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very 
unsatisfactory. I thought that I had only a 50% chance of 
passing. Even if I failed this subject I would not need to 
repeat. However I liked this subject very much and my results 
were bad because of my lazyness. If I was forced to change to a 
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling.",fear

like. The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation 
was like a debate. The atmosphere was very bad. When he learnt 
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost 
5 marks."" I was very angry, not because my marks were lower 
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride. I did not 
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work.",anger

I went to Guanggho alone. I was looking for an accomodation in

sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems. 
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.",fear

melody but had no content. We lived together so when he played
